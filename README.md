# Weather-Journal App Project

This repository is for the Weather Journal App project for Front End Web Development Proffesional track by FWD and Udacity

I used the starter project found [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/weather-journal-app)

I checked [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and the FWD zoom webinar for some help.

This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Node JS to create a web page that runs on a local server.
